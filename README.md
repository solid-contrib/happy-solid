# happy-solid

Happy Solid is new and in the making. 

You are invited to join the conversation about the ethical parametres of data sharing. Think FairTrade stamps for data sharing. 

The first W3C Solid Community Group call will be on Thursday 13th June at 1600CEST on https://zoom.us/j/8678621195. 

Agenda items include: 

* How could we apply the [ethical web principles](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/) to Solid?
* Who could we invite to co-create Happy Solid? 
* How could we go about defining the minimum amount of data one needs to share to exist in society while having access to human rights?

Please contact the Solid Manager, [Mitzi László](https://github.com/Mitzi-Laszlo), if you would like to add more items to the agenda or have any other suggestions.
