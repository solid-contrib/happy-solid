Happy Solid is new and in the making. You are invited to join the conversation about the ethical parametres of data sharing. Think FairTrade stamps for data sharing so that users of Solid can identify ethically trustworthy providers. 

There is a weekly W3C Solid Community Group call on Happy Solid. Find the dial in details and agenda on: https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Happy_Solid 

# How could we go about defining the minimum amount of data one needs to share to exist in society while having access to human rights?

Suggestions on approaches of how to ethically review Solid solutions include:  
* Is the Solid service provided essential to access human rights? 
* Data Minimisation: does the Solid provider use the minimum amount of data needed to provide the service?
